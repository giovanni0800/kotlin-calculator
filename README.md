    <p>Kotlin Calculator V2.0!</p>

## ðŸ“š About

It's a simple calculator developed in Kotlin language that can perform operations like:
Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division and Potentiation.

Here I used InteliJ and JDK 18.0.2.1 to practiced a little of Object Orientation,
flux control, keyboard reading, logic and I started to familiarize myself with the kotlin language
and some new syntaxes.
